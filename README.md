# Battleship

Battleship is a 2 player game that can be played locally. The ship locations are randomly generated and cannot be moved. When it is the user's turn, he/she clicks a square on the game board to shoot. Once a user wins, it will display the winner at the top of the page.

## Getting Started

`cd react-backend/client`

`npm install`
  
Next you will need to navigate to the client folder and execute:

`cd react-backend/client`

`npm start`
  
This will spin up a server on port 3000 for the frontend.
